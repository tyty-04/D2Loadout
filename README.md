A Hackathon project to create a loadout randomizer for the game Destiny 2.

Requires database downloadable at https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/sqlite/en/world_sql_content_dce16284390bc8c207e1ffc745927a59.content

I plan to make it actually function with the bungie api at some point so it can be used with player accounts and interact with the game.
